# Talks

Giving talks is something that I've wanted to get into for a while but have never really felt I had anything to say.  Regardless, due to some encouragement from my peers I've started to give some talks at various conventions the last year.

## 2015 02 20 - "Go Faster - Optimising Go Programs"

This is a talk I gave about optimizing Go programs at Gophercon India 2015.  There is a lot of hard info in here about the tools you have at your disposal when you use Go in order to successfully write performant code.  There are [slides](https://jmoiron.github.io/talks/go-faster/) and a [liveblog](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gopherconindia/111549295932) for this talk.

## 2015 10 02 - "The Network is the Computer"

This is a talk I will give soon at [Gotham Go](http://gothamgo.com/).  It is about architecting Go programs and how Go allows us to build programs using much of the same language and idioms that have been successfully brought to bear on architecture both in the large and the small in the last 40 years of software engineering.
