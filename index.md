# Talks

Giving talks is something that I've wanted to get into for a while but have never really felt I had anything to say.  Regardless, due to some encouragement from my peers I've started to give some talks at various conventions the last year.

## 2015 02 20 - "Go Faster - Optimising Go Programs"

This is a talk I gave about optimizing Go programs at Gophercon India 2015.  There is a lot of hard info in here about the tools you have at your disposal when you use Go in order to successfully write performant code.  There are [slides](https://jmoiron.github.io/talks/go-faster/) and a [liveblog](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gopherconindia/111549295932) for this talk.
